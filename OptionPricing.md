#### Introduction - Option Prices
Options in layman terms is a contract that gives the right but not an obligation to either buy or sell an assest( stocks/shares of a company/ foreign currencies/ commodities) on or before a certain date.

There are two types of options, **Call** and **Put**. When we buy a call option we wish that the option price goes up and when we buy a put option we wish that the option price goes down.
So, In general we can buy an option and then sell it in future (hopefully with highter price) Or we can sell an option as an opening trade and hopefully buy it back at a lower price as a closing trade.

A "Call" Option is a contract b/w two parties to exchange a stock at a "strike" price by a predetermined date. One party , the buyer of the "call", has the right, but not an obligation, to buy the stock at the strike price by the future date, while the other party, the seller of the call, has the obligation to sell the stock to the buyer at the strike price if the buyer exercises the option.

A "Put" Option is a contract b/w two parties to exchange a stock at a "strike" price, by a predetermine date. One party, the buyer of the "put" has the right , but not an obligation, to sell the stock at the strike price by the future date, while the other party , the seller of the put, has the obligation to buy the stock from the buyer at the strike price if the buyer exercises the option.

Option prices are based on 3 elements:
*  TIME TO EXPIRATION: -  Options have expiration dates. Just like in insurance we have to pay periodically a fixed amount , similar case happens with options. More the time , more the price you have to pay. Time decay happens as we go closer to expiration. This graph is exponential i.e as we go near expiration , time decay speeds up and option time value reaches 0 at the expiration date. Most stocks have options with weekly, monthly, quaterly exprations. We can choose any one of these to trade in. 

* UNDERLYING STOCK PRICE: for each stock we have multiple options at different price increments.These are called the option **strike price**. Strike price is the pre-determined price at which the shares of the stock will be exchanged (buy/ sell) if the option is exercised. Options are worthless at the expiration. Also, we do not have to hold our position until expiration. Ex: If we buy a call option today and the stock price goes up overnight then we can sell it and make profit rather than waiting for 30days which is the expiration date.


* VOLATILITY: Magnitude of a Stock's price swings. Higher volatility means more risk for the stock owner. Since more risk, it will cost us more money. 


The combination of these three factors determines the option prices.
